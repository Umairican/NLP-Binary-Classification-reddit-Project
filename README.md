### Problem Statement

Can my model tell if these are wonderful life pro tips, or shitty life pro tips?

The baseline for comparison with my models is simple, since this is a binary classification project: can my model outperform the age-old decision metric of flipping a coin (can my model beat 50/50)?


### Executive Summary

This project explores using different Natural Language Processing models to attempt a binary classification of the age-old question, "which subreddit is this coming from?"

For those of you who don't know, reddit(include link here)

Some words about this project go here.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

My conclusion here is that I am a bit burntout right this second and I could really do with some exercise and shit so I think I am going to do that instead for a little bit, and then get back to this later.
