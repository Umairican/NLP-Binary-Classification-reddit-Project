### Problem Statement

Can my model tell if these are wonderful life pro tips, or shitty life pro tips?

The baseline for comparison with my models is simple, since this is a binary classification project: can my model outperform the age-old decision metric of flipping a coin (can my model beat 50/50)?


### Executive Summary

This project explores using different Natural Language Processing models to attempt a binary classification of the age-old question, "which subreddit is this coming from?"

For those of you who don't know, reddit(include link here)

Some words about this project go here.

My first run-through of this project centered on the following subreddits:

LifeProTips:

Some yada about the subreddit


ShittyLifeProTips:

Some yada about the subreddit



My second run-through of this project centered on the following subreddits:

AskMen:


AskMenOver30:



My third run-through of this project centered on the following subreddits:

/r/MadMen:

A subreddit dedicated to one of TV's greatest shows. Don Draper, oozing with his effortless charm and complete disregard for the feelings of partners, 

/r/TheSopranos:

A subreddit dedicated to arguably the greatest TV series of all time.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

My conclusion here is that I am a bit burntout right this second and I could really do with some exercise and shit so I think I am going to do that instead for a little bit, and then get back to this later.

I chose similar subreddits because I wanted to explore the various themes of these subreddits and whether or not NLP models could pick up on more subtle differences between two options in binary classification.


/r/LifeProTips and /r/ShittyLifeProTips -> testing for sarcasm detection in natural language processing.
